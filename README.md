# MySherlock: A. Conan Doyle books - easy reading

I've been waiting to create a list of my favourite Conan Doyle books for quite a while... and I'm excited about this project as I wish to re-read all the books and also make it easy for others to achieve that, online.

I've came across [Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) - A Meaningful Web Typography Starter Kit - and found the perfect companion to *MySherlock* project, which will use files from [The Project Gutenberg] (http://www.gutenberg.org/) to showcase my favourite books from A. Conan Doyle - Sherlock Holmes stories...


## Project outline
My intent is to transform each of the books in turn, enrich with illustrations (coming from my own imagination and some research). The first book is added below (just typography applied, no other review done):
- [A Study in Scarlet](http://monicams.github.io/MySherlock/A-Study-In-Scarlet/)

##History

###Kick-off of the project

*June 14, 2016*

- Forked [Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) and added the first book in a 'basic structure', still to review and correct any 'blips'.

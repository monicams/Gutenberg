# MySherlock: A. Conan Doyle books - easy reading

I've been waiting to create a list of my favourite Conan Doyle books for quite a while... I think [Project Gutenberg] (http://www.gutenberg.org/) is great and helped many students and general readers alike to embrace the stories and enjoy the books that are in public domain.
I've came across [Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) - A Meaningful Web Typography Starter Kit - and found the perfect companion to my project, as my intent was to create an easy-to-read site with my favourite books, here starting with Sherlock Holmes stories...

## Project outline
My intent is to transform each of the books in turn, enrich with illustrations (coming from my own imagination and some research).

##History

###Kick-off of the project

*June 14, 2016*

- Forked [Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) and added the first book in a 'basic structure', still to review and correct any 'blips'.
